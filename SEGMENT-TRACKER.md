## Token Usage Guidelines

1. Each implementation segment should:
   - Focus on modifying 2-4 files maximum
   - Keep changes focused and minimal
   - Use replace_in_file for targeted changes
   - Split large file changes across segments

2. Code Review Strategy:
   - Review changes one file at a time
   - Use diff-based reviews
   - Focus on critical paths first

3. Testing Approach:
   - Write minimal, focused tests
   - Test only changed functionality
   - Keep test files small and specific

4. Documentation Rules:
   - Keep documentation concise
   - Document only what changed
   - Use bullet points over paragraphs
