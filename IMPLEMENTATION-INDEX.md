# Implementation Index

## Core Segments
Each segment is tracked in its own file to prevent token overload:

1. [API Implementation](./implementation/API-IMPL.md)
2. [UI Components](./implementation/UI-IMPL.md)
3. [Features](./implementation/FEATURES-IMPL.md)
4. [Documentation](./implementation/DOCS-IMPL.md)
5. [Testing](./implementation/TESTING-IMPL.md)

## Status Reference
ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Current Focus Areas
- API Implementation: Moisture readings endpoint
- UI Components: Mobile responsiveness
- Features: Theme system integration

## Implementation Rules
1. Each segment file should focus on a single area
2. Keep segment files under 500 lines
3. Use cross-references instead of duplicating content
4. Update status in segment files only
