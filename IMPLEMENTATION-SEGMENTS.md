## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with Theme Switcher as it's smaller and will affect the entire application
2. Proceed with Mobile Menu Enhancements to improve current functionality
3. Finally implement API Playground as the largest feature

Each segment can be implemented independently to maintain manageable scope and allow for easier testing and validation.
