# Refined Implementation Segments

## Core Principle
Each segment is designed to be small enough to prevent token overload (staying well under 200,000 tokens) while maintaining logical cohesion.

## 1. API Playground Implementation

### Segment 1A: Basic Structure
- Component scaffolding
- Basic layout
- Types definition
Maximum files touched: 3-4

### Segment 1B: Request Builder - Basic
- HTTP method selector
- URL input field
Maximum files touched: 2-3

### Segment 1C: Request Builder - Advanced
- Headers configuration
- Request body editor
Maximum files touched: 2-3

### Segment 1D: Response Display - Basic
- Status code display
- Headers view
Maximum files touched: 2-3

### Segment 1E: Response Display - Advanced
- Response body formatting
- Pretty printing
Maximum files touched: 2-3

### Segment 1F: History Feature
- Request history implementation
- History storage
Maximum files touched: 2-3

### Segment 1G: Save/Load Feature
- Save request functionality
- Load request functionality
Maximum files touched: 2-3

## 2. Theme System Implementation

### Segment 2A: Core Theme Setup
- Theme configuration
- Basic context
Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 2B: Theme Storage
- Theme persistence
- Local storage integration
Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 2C: Theme Selector UI

Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 2E: Quick Toggle
- Toggle component
- Animation implementation
Maximum files touched: 2

## 3. Mobile Menu Enhancement

### Segment 3A: Gesture System
- Basic gesture handling
- Touch event setup
Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 3B: Animation
- Performance optimization
- Smooth transitions
Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 3C: UX Features
- State persistence
- Scroll memory
Maximum files touched: 2

### Segment 3D: Error Handling
- Error states
- Loading indicators
Maximum files touched: 2

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Each segment should:
   - Focus on a single, atomic feature
   - Modify 2-4 files maximum
   - Be completable in 2-4 hours
   - Have clear entry/exit criteria

2. Token Management:
   - Keep file modifications minimal
   - Use targeted edits over full file rewrites
   - Split large changes across multiple segments

3. Testing Strategy:
   - Each segment includes its own tests
   - Tests should be minimal but effective
   - Focus on critical functionality

4. Documentation:
   - Brief, focused documentation per segment
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies listed upfront

This refined segmentation ensures each task stays well within token limits while maintaining clear progress tracking and manageable scope.
