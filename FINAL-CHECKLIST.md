## Next Steps

1. Prioritize remaining tasks based on criticality
2. Assign resources to complete outstanding items
3. Set up staging environment for final testing
4. Create deployment timeline
5. Prepare rollback procedures
6. Schedule user training
7. Plan post-deployment monitoring

## Notes
- All critical items must be completed before deployment
- Testing should be performed in staging environment
- User training materials should be prepared in parallel
- Documentation must be completed before user onboarding
- Monitoring systems should be in place before launch
