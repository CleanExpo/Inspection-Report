## Quick Start

### 1. Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/moisture-inspector.git

# Install dependencies
cd moisture-inspector
npm install

# Start voice service locally
npm run voice-service:dev
```

### 2. Key Integration Points
```typescript
// Initialize voice service
import { VoiceService } from '@moisture-inspector/voice';

const voiceService = await VoiceService.initialize({
  apiKey: process.env.VOICE_API_KEY,
  environment: 'development'
});

// Start voice recognition
await voiceService.startListening();

// Process voice command
voiceService.onCommand(async (command) => {
  const result = await voiceService.processCommand(command);
  console.log('Command processed:', result);
});
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:voice

# Run integration tests
npm run test:voice:integration

# Run performance tests
npm run test:voice:performance
```

## Common Tasks

### 1. Adding New Commands
1. Define command in [voice-commands.md](voice-commands.md)
2. Implement command handler
3. Add unit tests
4. Update documentation

### 2. Monitoring Health
```bash
# Check service health
curl https://voice-api.moisture-inspector.com/health

# View logs
tail -f /var/log/voice-service/application.log

# Check metrics
curl https://voice-api.moisture-inspector.com/metrics
```

### 3. Troubleshooting
1. Check [Troubleshooting Guide](voice-troubleshooting-guide.md)
2. Review service logs
3. Monitor metrics dashboard
4. Follow recovery procedures
