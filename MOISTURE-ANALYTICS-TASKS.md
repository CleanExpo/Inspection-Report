## Macro Tasks (High Level)

### 1. Database Setup & Validation
Combines micro tasks from Database Layer to ensure data storage and retrieval works correctly.

### 2. API Implementation
Groups API Layer micro tasks to create a robust endpoint structure.

### 3. Analytics Engine
Combines Analytics Processing micro tasks to build the core functionality.

### 4. Quality Assurance
Groups Testing & Validation micro tasks to ensure reliability.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Each micro task should:
   - Have a clear, single responsibility
   - Be completable in under 15 minutes
   - Have defined inputs and outputs
   - Be independently testable

2. Macro tasks should:
   - Combine related micro tasks
   - Have clear completion criteria
   - Be completable in under 1 hour
   - Be independently deployable

3. Task Execution:
   - Complete one micro task at a time
   - Validate before moving to next task
   - Document any issues or blockers
   - Regular commits after each micro task

## Progress Tracking

- Use checkboxes to mark completed tasks
- Add completion dates for tracking
- Note any dependencies between tasks
- Document any issues encountered

This breakdown ensures:
- Manageable chunks of work
- Clear progress tracking
- Reduced token usage per interaction
- Better error isolation
- Easier debugging and maintenance
