# Database Testing Segments

## Connection Tests
File: connection.test.ts
Split into:
1. Basic Connection Tests
   - Connection establishment
   - Connection pooling
   - Timeout handling

2. Error Handling Tests
   - Invalid credentials
   - Network failures
   - Reconnection attempts

3. Performance Tests
   - Connection pool optimization
   - Query execution time
   - Resource cleanup

## Middleware Tests
File: middleware.test.ts
Split into:
1. Logging Tests
   - Query logging
   - Error logging
   - Performance metrics

2. Performance Monitoring Tests
   - Query timing
   - Resource usage
   - Bottleneck detection

3. Data Validation Tests
   - Input sanitization
   - Output validation
   - Type checking

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Each test file should focus on one segment
2. Maximum 5 test cases per file
3. Clear setup and teardown procedures
4. Explicit test dependencies

## Progress Tracking
- Track completion status with checkmarks
- Note any blockers or dependencies
- Document performance baselines
- Record test coverage metrics

## File Organization
```
__tests__/db/
  connection/
    basic.test.ts
    errors.test.ts
    performance.test.ts
  middleware/
    logging.test.ts
    monitoring.test.ts
    validation.test.ts
```

## Token Usage Note
Each test file should be worked on independently to prevent token limit issues. When implementing tests:
1. Focus on one test segment at a time
2. Complete all test cases in a segment before moving on
3. Validate and commit after each segment completion
4. Document any cross-segment dependencies
